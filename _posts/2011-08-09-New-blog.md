Hi People,

this is now my third attempt to start a successful blog. Chances are it won't last long. However, lately lots of interesting stuff is going on in my life which I want to write about.

For example, the next couple of posts might be about the creation of my bachelor thesis on the topic of mathematical [game theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), or my experiences in the German entrepreneur and start-up scene.

Hope you stick around long enough to enjoy ma little stories.

Kind Regards,
Valentin
