I  love crowdfunding. I'm constantly amazed by the project people are working, let it be [Arduino based Satellites](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space?ref=live) or the [OUYA game system for your TV](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console?ref=live). What I was wondering is if large corporations could use that kind of financing to develop products and features that would have a hard time to get enough budgets for internal financing.

Let me give you an example. O2 Telefonica in Germany has a handy [visual voice mail app for the iPhone](http://www.o2online.de/nw/student/handys/iphone/voicemail/).

But Android users are left alone with the annoying and hard to use dial tone menu. Taking a look at the [Mein O2 App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=canvasm.myo2) it has been downloaded at least 100.000 times. So if 10% of that user would pay 1â‚¬ for such an app, it may be already enough to finance that.

However I'm not aware of any company that uses crowdfunding (Please leave a comment if I'm wrong). This format of financing and funding is still stuck in the independent project and startup-space.
