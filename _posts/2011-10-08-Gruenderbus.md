These days something very cool is going on in Germany. The [Gründerbus](http://www.gruenderbus.de/Gruenderbus/GruenderBus.html) will be on tour!

The Gründerbus (= Founders Bus in German) is a 10 day road trip for aspiring entrepreneurs across Germany. In these 10 days they will meet Entrepreneurs and VCs like [Venture Stars](http://www.venture-stars.com/) and [Hanse Ventures](http://www.hanseventures.com/).

The Idea and the Stations of the trip sounded awesome so that I just had to sign up for this in August. In the meantime I started working for [EnergyBob](http://www.energybob.com/) and as one could have expected: In a start up in it's early phase there are deadlines to meet and important tasks to do, so it would be tricky to get a 10 day leave.
However I have not heard back from Gründerbus in a while so I thought I did not get picked anyway and there will be no dilemma after all.... until last week!

Last Week, Jan from Gründerbus wrote me that I could be part of it, but at EnergyBob there are so many things to do so that I could not afford a 10 day leave! Damnit!

I'd really love to be part of this incredible experience. At least I can attend their kick-off in Munich but when it comes to board the bus I will be left behind. Luckily Frank, a friend of mine, will go on this trip. So hopefully he and Twitter will keep me posted!
