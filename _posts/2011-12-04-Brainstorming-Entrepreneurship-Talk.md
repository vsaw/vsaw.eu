Last week I've been asked to give a talk in front of 500 university students about "entrepreneurship". Since this is a very large topic I'm trying to find out what people are especially interested.

Therefore I'd be very cool if you find time to help me brainstorm and put your questions in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EQjXU0bycHePdaJ7_mZk-F-YmuIWTcQ7Jj78zLS_CxU/edit). I'll be reviewing them tomorrow and let you know what I came up with.

Thanks!
