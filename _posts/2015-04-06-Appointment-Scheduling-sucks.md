Appointment scheduling sucks! It always goes like "Hey how about this Saturday?", "Oh no I can't Saturday. What about next Tuesday?" and so on and so forth. Also it only get's worse with more and more people involved.

# How people organize their Appointments
The ongoing [Survey "How do you schedule appointments?"](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PVUiWdEOFaJeeXSRSJoOKxePBqbK4XNUCoRP-sAf73k/viewform) show the following picture of how people organize their Appointments

- Mobile electric calendars are dominating
- Most appointments are scheduled remotely. Face to Face is the exception
- Mobile text messaging is the most used and even preferred way to schedule appointments
- Appointments are synchronized across more than one calendar. Work and Facebook calendars are also included in lots of cases

# State of current Appointment Scheduling
Now let's take a look at the tools that are supposed to help us schedule our appointments

### Calendar Sharing
This is a permanent settings that is used in close groups like co-workers but you are not sharing your calendar with the casual friend you'd like to see again

**Advantages**

- Works great for one on one meetings
- Works best with iCal invitations

**Disadvantages**

- Have to manually manage sharing settings
- Bad support for Groups: Event Organizer needs to see everyones calendar
- Works best with iCal invites, but iCal invitations are not popular

### Online Group Scheduling Tools
Tools like [Doodle](http://doodle.com) or [www.timeup.io](http://www.timeup.io) help to find an open timeslot if you want to meet with a group of people.

**Advantages**

- Easy to invite people
- Easy to review the found appointment

**Disadvantages**

- You have to check your calendar manually
- Easy to get lost with lots of appointment alternatives as Doodle Tables get large, especially on mobile devices
- Easy to double book free slots if more than one poll is open at the same time

### Dedicated Group Scheduling Apps
Apps like [Group Scheduler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iljadica.aap) that aim to help us schedule group appointments

**Advantages**

- Suitable for Mobile Devices
- Integrate into the calendar and have easy sharing built in

**Disadvantages**

- It's an empty disco. Noboby uses these apps as all parties are required to use them for them to work

### Manual Invitation through Text Messages or Email

**Advantages**

- Easy, natural way to mention dates in a conversation

**Disadvantages**

- Painful to agree on dates (typical Ping Pong of alternatives)
- Works bad in groups (easy to lose track of mentioned dates and times)
- You have to check your calendar manually

# Next Level Appointment Scheduling
So it is clear that the way we invite people to events does not match the way calendars are used. The most important missing features are

- Easy link between text messaging and calendar
- Automatic Free timeslot discovery without constant user interaction
- Suitable for mobile devices
- Group Scheduling has to be a prime Use Case

Let's see how this can be done in a fun to use way. If you have some idea reach out to me!
